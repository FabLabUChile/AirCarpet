Design: It is the same basic prototype design but expanded, the final shape will have 18 racquetball balls connected by quick connections "T" type union,
"elbow" type and polyurethane's tubes. The system converges to a "H" type unidirectional valve, which is connected to "Cross" type connection,
this connection connects to a manometer, to a cistern of Paintball and to a manual valve which allows open and close the step to air stored on the cistern,
this valve it's driven for a servo connected to Arduino, at the same time this Arduino is connected to the manometer.

The balls and pipeline's system is inside of a acrylic and wood box (the acrylic parts and the general planes of the box are inside of this folder)


Operation: the footsteps on the carpet causes that the system stores compressed air in the cistern.When it reaches a certain pressure, the Arduino 
commands the servo to open the manual valve and so allow the air release inside for it's later use.
